# Overview


This repo is home to various deployments flavor for canopy focusing mainly on providing a proper local development enviroment and a secure but flexible staging/production environments as well

Checkout [our official node running docs](https://canopy-network.gitbook.io/docs/node-runner/setup) for production builds


### Validator configuration

For configuring your own validator on canopy mainnet chainID 1 and 2 you need to create your keystore.json and validator_key.json.

This command will ask for your password and username and will create the previous files and store it on `canopy_data/node1/`  which is the datadir that we use for our deployment tooling


```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
